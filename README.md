# LaunchBeat 
### ‚å®Ô∏è + üéµ = ‚ù§Ô∏è
The purpose of this project is to make music easier to learn for non-musicians by leveraging the similarity between Launchpad grid controllers and computer keyboards.


### Project Goals
- To introduce incoming musicians to notes, chords and scales.
- Programmatically generate chord shapes for Launchpad, accounting for different layouts.
- Create a list of resources to help new musicians develop a deeper understanding of music theory and music production.
