The purpose of this project is to make music easier to learn for new musicians by leveraging the similarity between Launchpad grid controllers and computer keyboards.


### Project Goals
- Introduce incoming musicians to notes, chords and scales.
- Programmatically generate chord shapes for Launchpad, accounting for different layouts.
